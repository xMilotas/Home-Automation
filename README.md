# Home-Automation Project

Simple Node.JS webserver with API routes to enable power plug control via webapp. 

This API used by my automation workflows and [Porcupine](https://github.com/xMilotas/Porcupine).

Also hosts a virtual fireplace which was inspired by a smart mirror. We usually have this running on the TV when we have friends over. Makes for a nice cosy athmosphere.
